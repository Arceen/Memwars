## Introduction

### General

Memwars has been an app that I've been planning for a couple of years. I love Memory Challenges and read a lot of content online on improving memory and concentration.
This is an app that I hope, will provide the casual and competitive memory challenges that I see getting introduced as a fundamental memory training.
The app itself is going to be a base list of games that you can play, I plan on building 8 games (technically 4 with each having easy/hard options).
It's also going to have some stats that you can see and measure how good you're doing. Again, some basic timer stuff.


### The App seems very basic. Why build it?

The great thing about this app is that it does not bring anything new to the table. So I do not have to worry about great ideas. Sure they might pop up but it's not going to alter the simple core functionality of this app.
For this application, I am using an Waterfall SDLC model and following proper Design Patterns, Clean Code as much as I can.
Because I mean instead of having a great deal of cool arbitrary functions somehow taped together tg. The main focus of this project is better design patterns, clean code, 

Although, I'd like for it to be a great and usable app with fun and challenging games that is also going to improve memory. It is more about improving my personal development process.
So, for this app, rather than making a great app through poor process and code jumbled together from here and there to make things just work, I'm focusing on making a good app through proper process.

Other priorities include:
 - Maintain Clean Code
 - Incorporate Necessary Design Patterns 
 - Keeping Documentation 
 - Meeting Time Goals for the App 
 - Proper Version-ing based on features added
 - Use JWT for Auth (Low priority for now)
